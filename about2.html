<h2>About the Geo-PKO project</h2>

<p>The Geo-PKO dataset is a project by Uppsala University’s Department of Peace and Conflict Research. It is one of the first to enable scholars, students, analysts and the public to explore variations in peacekeeping at the sub-national level. Analysis and visualisation can provides insight into themes such as troop composition and peacekeeping presence across geographic boundaries.</p>
