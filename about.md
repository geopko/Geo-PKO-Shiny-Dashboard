## About the Geo-PKO project
The Geo-PKO dataset is a collaborative project by Deniz Cil (University of Maryland) and Hanne Fjelde, Lisa Hultman, and Desirée Nilsson (Uppsala University). The first data collection began in 2012, and it now covers all UN peacekeeping missions globally, 1994-2020. The dataset enables scholars, students, analysts, and the public to explore variations in peacekeeping at the sub-national level.
