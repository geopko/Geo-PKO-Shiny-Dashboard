## About the Geo-PKO project
The Geo-PKO dataset is a collaborative project by Deniz Cil (University of Maryland) and Hanne Fjelde, Lisa Hultman, and Desirée Nilsson (Uppsala University). The first data collection process began in 2012; the dataset now covers all UN peacekeeping missions globally, 1994-2019. With its broad inclusion of cases, we hope that scholars, students, analysts, and the public will find the dataset useful for exploring variations in peacekeeping at the national and sub-national levels.

## About this website
This website and the interactive visualisations were created by Nguyen Ha, Lou van Roozendaal, and Tanushree Rao (research assistants at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University). You can learn more about the script used to produce this application [on GitHub](http://github.com/geopko/Geo-PKO-Shiny-Dashboard). Since this is an evolving project, we would love to hear if you have any suggestion for improvement, or if you have encountered any issue while using the app. 

## Funding
The data collection has been enabled by the generous support of the Folke Bernadotte Academy, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Smith Richardson Foundation, and the Minerva Initiative of the US Department of Defense/Air Force Office of Scientific Research.
