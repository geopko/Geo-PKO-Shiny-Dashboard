# Geo-PKO-Shiny-Dashboard

Where are peacekeepers deployed? This project uses the Geocoded Peacekeeping Operations (Geo-PKO) dataset to visualize deployment locations and its attributes - troop strength, contributing countries, and troop capabilities.

This GitHub repository contains the codes used to produce the app. Since this is an evolving project, we would love to hear if you have any suggestion for improvement, or if you have encountered any issue while using this dashboard.
